# Calculator App

This is a basic calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Overview

This project is my first step in learning Python GUI development with Tkinter. By creating this calculator, I'm practicing the foundational skills required for building user interfaces in Python, such as:

  1) Organizing layouts with Tkinter frames
  2) Styling widgets
  3) Implementing button functionalities
  4) Inserting and deriving data from external files


Features

  1) Basic Arithmetic: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and power.
  2) Clear Button: Reset the display to start new calculations.
  3) Shows the history of calculations


Getting Started

To run the calculator:

  1) Make sure you have Python installed.

  2) Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/x0byte/tkinter_gui_calculator.git
  ```

Run the application with:
```
python main.py
```
